# Warning About piracy
Normally, you are not allowed to keep comics for more than 30 days. While this tool allows you to bypass that limit, you CANNOT under any circumstances upload the material downloaded anywhere else, regardless of intent. This tool is only meant to be used for reading comics offline without the 30 day limit. I will not be held liable for any sort of copyright infringement that you - the end user - may perform using my tools.
